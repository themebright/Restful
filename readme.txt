== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Setting Up Front Page =

When you install the theme, it will initially look like a blog. To make the theme look like the screenshot, follow these steps:

1. Create another new page that will function as the home page. This can be titled whatever you like. "Home" or "Welcome" are good options. In the Page Attributes box, select "Home" in the Page Template drop down. Enter your desired content and publish the page.
2. Create and publish another page for your blog if you wish to use posts. You don't need to enter any content on this one.
3. Browse to Settings â†’ Reading and select "Static Front Page" radio option.
4. Select your new home page and blog page in the appropriate drop downs. Save your changes.
